I had a small talk last week about react native & ux stuff, not thorough or so but I guess I could write down some here.

you could also download the keynote file [here](https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0PcpWV11TPCNgg6T6jxGCymAQ#improve-ux-in-react-native).

### From React Native Document
not very interested but many importants mentioned here.

### Micro-interactions
* instant way to get users to fall in love with your application.
* playing with lottie - just a cool library.

### Offline Support
- some examples.
- `redux-persist` to persist application data for offline usage.
- `react-native-offline` for re-dispatch actions when internet state changes.

### Optimistic UI
* most of it: [True Lies Of Optimistic User Interfaces â€” Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/11/true-lies-of-optimistic-user-interfaces/)
