      It’s just that the cause wasn’t real.
      The cause was imagined.
      The cause was fear.
      Let’s leave the Jews out o
      this just for a moment.
      Let’s think of another minority.
      One that…
      One that can go unnoticed if it needs to.
      There are all sorts of minorities,
      blondes for example…
      …or people with freckles.
      But a minority is only
      thought of as one…
      …when it constitutes some kind of
      threat to the majority.
      A real threat or an imagined one.
      And therein lies the fear.
      If the minority is somehow invisible…
      …and the fear is much greater.
      That fear is why the
      minority is persecuted.
      So, you see there always is a cause.
      The cause is fear.
      Minorities are just people.
      People like us.
